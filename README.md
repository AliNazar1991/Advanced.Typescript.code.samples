Make sure you have installed @types/node using the following command in project root:

### Definitions

Type annotations : code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to, that is, we developers tell typescript the type of a variable or object etc.
Ex: const apples: number = 5;
In above code statement, ": number" is called the type annotation.
Type annotations works with all object types (functions, arrays, classes, objects) and primitive types, string, number, symbol, null etc

Type inference : Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to, that is, typescript tries to guess the type of an object, variable etc.
